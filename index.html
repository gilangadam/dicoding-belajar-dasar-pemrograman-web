                <p>In January 2012, Bergling was hospitalized for 11 days in New York City with acute pancreatitis caused by excessive alcohol use.</p>

                <p>On April 20, 2018, his lifeless body was found in his hotel room near Muscat, Oman. A few days later, his family revealed that he had cut himself and bled to death. With Avicii’s suicide, another bright star of the music industry dimmed
                    forever. The concept of the “tortured artist” had once again made its presence felt. He was 28 years old at the time of his death, but his music shall always remain ageless and immortal.</p>

                    <p>Avicii inspired many artists in the EDM genre, many of whom paid tribute to him after his death. Norwegian DJ Kygo cited Avicii as "[his] biggest inspiration and the reason why [he] started making electronic music. " In addition, artists
                        like Alan Walker and DubVision described him as an "icon " in EDM. Other artists such as Diplo, Sebastian Ingrosso, Felix Jaehn, and Martin Garrix, the last of whom collaborated with Avicii on his 2015 single "Waiting for Love
                        ", have also cited him as a source of inspiration, with the songs "Levels " and "Seek Bromance " being specifically mentioned as points of inspiration.</p>
                    <p>On the day of his death, The Washington Post wrote an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/was-avicii-trying-to-bridge-edm-and-country-and-did-anyone-dare-walk-across/2018/04/20/788924aa-44d3-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html "
                            target="_blank ">article</a> citing Avicii as a pioneer artist in the attempt to bridge the gap between country and electronic music, crediting his 2013 hits "Wake Me Up " and "Hey Brother " as a good example of this movement.
                        Avicii is also credited for influencing other attempts at continuing this genre crossover, including songs such as Zedd's "The Middle " and Hailee Steinfeld's "Let Me Go ".</p>
                    <p>Avicii also influenced a number of mainstream artists outside electronic music. Nile Rodgers said that in terms of melody writing, Avicii was "maybe one of the best, if not the best I’ve ever worked with. " Mike Einziger of Incubus
                        said "Some of the work we did together is some of the music I’m most proud of in my whole life. " Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons said "working with [Avicii] was one of my favorite collaborative moments. " Charlie Puth said that
                        Avicii was "The man who really opened my eyes as to what my productions could one day sound like. " Eric Clapton, who never publicly worked with Avicii, said he was "Inspired by Avicii ", and dedicated a song off his Christmas
                        album, Happy Xmas, to him.</p>
                    <p>In October 2019, Avicii was honoured with a waxwork statue at the Madame Tussauds museum in New York City.</p>
                    <p>On 21 November of the same year, Billboard named Avicii's 2011 hit "Levels " as <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8543859/avicii-levels-songs-that-defined-the-decade">one of the one hundred songs which defined the 2010s</a>,
                        whereas his 2013 hit "Wake Me Up " came 13th (and was the highest charting EDM song) on the Official Charts Company's chart of the decade.</p>
